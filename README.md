# OkazuStudio

OkazuStudio is a specialized, client-side web application designed to streamline the workflow of combining and polishing image variants. It removes the friction of heavy image editors, allowing you to rapidly resolve differences between versions of an artwork—such as swapping facial expressions, mixing outfit elements, or removing watermarks—without the overhead of setting up layers and project files.

## Use Cases

*   **Variant Merging**: Create the perfect composite from multiple imperfect generations. For example, if you have a "Smile with red dress" variant and a "Frown with black dress" variant, you can easily paint the smiling face onto the black dress body to create a "Smile with black dress" final image.
*   **Removal of Watermarks**: If you have two variants where one is watermarked and the other is clean (but perhaps has other defects), use the clean sections of one to paint over the watermark on the other.
*   **Rapid Censoring**: The masking workflow is optimized for privacy edits; simply "poke holes" in the image to reveal an obfuscated version of itself below. This setup is automatic, saving time compared to manual filter layers.
*   **Finishing Touches**: Because compositing often requires tweaking tones or final polish, a full suite of color balance, levels, and exposure tools is built right in. Tweak your final output without leaving the browser.

## Features

*   **Dual-Image Compositing**: Drag-and-drop workflow to blend two source images (Slots A and B).
*   **Advanced Masking**:
    *   **Erase & Repair**: Paint with additive or subtractive brushes to reveal or hide layers.
    *   **Precision Control**: Adjustable brush size, hardness, and polyline drawing.
*   **Integrated Adjustments**: A comprehensive toolset to unify your composite, offering exposure control (gamma, shadows, highlights), levels, color balance (saturation, vibrance, white balance), and channel-specific fine-tuning.
*   **Privacy First**: Zero data upload. All processing occurs locally in your browser using HTML5 Canvas.
